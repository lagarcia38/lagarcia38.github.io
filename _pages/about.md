Hi! I'm **Dr. Luis Antonio Garcia**. I am a Research Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [USC](https://www.usc.edu) and a Research Lead at the [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) focusing on the security and safety of learning-enabled Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)/Internet-of-Things (IoT). I previously held a postdoctoral appointment at the [Networked & Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://nesl.ucla.edu/) at the [UCLA ECE Department](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), collaborating with [Dr. Mani Srivastava](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/mani-srivastava/). I have my PhD in Computer Engineering with a Cybersecurity focus from [Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), where my research advisor was [Dr. Saman Zonouz](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/). My [dissertation](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/59094/) was titled "Physics for the Sake of Security, Security for the Sake of Physics". Please don't confuse me with the other Dr. Luis Garcia from Rutgers that roamed the academic world of the 80's.

I was previously an academic intern at the [Logical Systems Lab](https://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I collaborated with [Dr. Andr√© Platzer](http://symbolaris.com/) in 2017. We worked on the verification of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the context of cyber-physical systems. I also interned as a Software Developer Intern at [Siemens Corporate Research](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) in 2015 working with Dr. Dong Wei on PLC security.


Research Interests
======
I develop methods to ensure trustworthy and resilient autonomous systems that interact with humans both in and on control loops. Driven by real-world stakeholders, my goal is to enable a relationship for providing mutual assurances between deep-learning-enabled cyber-physical systems and humans in safety-critical contexts. In particular, my research aims to answer the following three questions: In particular, my research aims to answer the following three questions:
* **Leveraging semantics to retrofit security and resiliency.**. For deployed and legacy systems, how can we leverage knowledge about a cyber-physical system's semantics, e.g., the underlying physical equations, to enhance safety and security at all levels of the software stack? 
* **Integrating Human Logic & Deep Learning for Trustworthy Autonomous Design**. What are the correct ways to interface symbolic knowledge and deep learning models in cyber-physical systems that allow humans to understand and intervene decision-making processes? 
* **Secure, Private, and Useful Ubiquitous Sensing**. With the explosion of IoT sensors, how can we expose useful programming abstractions to developers while ensuring secure and private cyber-physical information flow?
